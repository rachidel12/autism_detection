# autism_detection
this is an android mobile app for detecting autism using Deep Learning.
<br />
We built the model using the transfer learning and the code for creating the model is in the notebook.
<br /> 
<br />
Then we converted the model to a tensorflow lite format so the mobile application can use it. We built the app using Android Studio.
